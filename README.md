About the Wayne State University Linux Users Group
--------------------------------------------------

The Wayne State University Linux Users Group exists to support
and promote the use of Linux, UNIX and other Open Source
technologies at Wayne State University and the surrounding
community.

We're comprised primarily of students and staff, as well as alumni
and other people interested in open source software, free software,
Linux and Unix operating systems, and other related things. 

Using Linux as your primary operating system is not required to be
involved, but we will talk behind your back if you don't. A lot.
